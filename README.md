# Introduction

Here we create a model which will predict the purity of an ore using the various lab result values, done on a sample of that ore..

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is take from the Kaggle website.
<br>
<b>Dataset Link:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edumagalhaes/quality-prediction-in-a-mining-process </b>
<br>
In this dataset there is a table which contains 24 columns and around 735000 rows.
<br>
<b>Some of the columns are:</b>% Iron Feed, % Silica Feed, Starch Flow, Ore Pulp Flow, Floatation columns and so on.

# Aim

The main aim is to build a model using various approaches that will be able to predict an ore's purity and impurity using the different column values as input.

# Approach

We will try to build the models using different algorithms of ML and DL and compare their accuracy. In this notebook we will be building models using Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Networks.
