# Iron Ore-Quality Prediction

TE Mini Project topic. 

**Summary:**<br>
We are trying to create a platform that will help customers who require a certain % purity of Iron to find Mining plants near them that provide the same.

<br>
"It comes as no surprise that iron ore is considered **the strength behind the world’s leading industries.** As an integral component in the formation of steel, iron ore is **the world’s most commonly used metal** and critical to nearly every industry, from energy and construction to transportation and equipment manufacturing."

# Website Idea

**Summary**:<br>
We are trying to make a web which will connect mining plants and buyers(steel factories, etc) who need some x% pure iron. The mining plants will enter the lab results and then the ML model will predict the purity of ores found in that particular plant. Later on it updates the mining plant's details along with its purity. The buyers will be able to find mining plants that have the x% pure iron.
